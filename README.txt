Please note that this mod is capable of working in previous versions of the game.

All that's needed is a simple version change in the mod_info.json file,
which can be done by simply copying the version name from a mod made for your current version of the game and pasting it over Astral Ascension's.

This mod is, to our knowledge, capable of working in most versions of the game, primarily 0.96 and 0.95.
We do not know if it works in even earlier updates. Likely probably, but don't get your hopes up.

Originally, this mod was two - Astral Assembly and Colonial Ascension. Since both mods were Identical, we decided to merge them together for clarity.
