partialecumenopolis,PLANET,"Industrially chocked, hazardous, and yet teeming with all things human. This planet is a Lesser Ecumenopolis - a world that in every sense of the word is a human hive. For better or worst, this world displays the healing of the Sector.",,,,
fullecumenopolis,PLANET,"A world that holds no true bounds, cities upon cities glisten like starfire across it's breadth. This world is a Ecumenopolis, a world city, and that is under no exaggeration. With a population in the Tens of Trillions, this world surpasses even the many middle tier planets of the Domain, at least not those of the Core.",,,,
hyperecumenopolis,PLANET,"This world isn't just an ecumenopolis, but a Nexus of hyperspatial energies. A focus from which Space-Time has been twisted to provide further and further space. With a population in the Quadrillions, this world holds no sign of stopping in its relentless growth.",,,,
matrioshkaworld,PLANET,"With nowhere to grow, this world and it's polity have begun to expand into the surrounding orbitals. Massive layers of solid Adamantite hold up freshly imported oceans and continents, which in turn hold new habitable land for a population in the Quintillions. Some layers of this world are even repurposed for military and logistical backing.",,,,
astralworld,PLANET,"This isn't a world anymore, but a wormhole nexus into a nascent and expanding Basement Universe. Despite the term, a basement universe is no less independent than the standard 'normal' universe - the only thing keeping it tethered is the wormhole itself. Despite all this, with virtually unlimited and tailored space to expand into, the population here is growing in explosive fits.",,,,
